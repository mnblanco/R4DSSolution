## Exercises 12.2.1

Using prose, describe how the variables and observations are organised in
    each of the sample tables.
    
In `table1` each row is a (country, year) with variables `cases` and `population`.
```{r}
table1
```

In `table2` each row is a (country, year, type) with variable count.  Type is the `cases` and `population`.  `count` variable is the numeric value of the combination.
```{r}
table2
```

In `table3` each row is a (country, year) with variable rate (`cases` / `population`).  `rate` is the rate of cases to population as a character string in the format `"cases/rate"`.
```{r}
table3
```

In `table4a` each row is a country with variables `1999` and `2000`.  The value is the the `cases`.
```{r}
table4a
```

In `table4b` each row is a country with variables `1999` and `2000`.  The value is the the `population`.
```{r}
table4b
```

In `table5` each row is a (country, century, year) with variable rate (`cases` / `population`).  The original `year` was split into (century, year).

```{r}
table5
```

Compute the rate for table2, and table4a + table4b. You will need to perform four operations:

Compute the `rate` for `table2`, and `table4a` + `table4b`. 
    You will need to perform four operations:

    Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.
    Extract the matching population per country per year.
    Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.
    Store back in the appropriate place.
    
    Which representation is easiest to work with? Which is hardest? Why?
    
Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.

```{r}
t2_cases <- table2 %>% filter(type == "cases") %>% select(-type) %>% rename(cases = count )
t4_cases <- table4a %>% gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

Extract the matching population per country per year.

```{r}
t2_pop <- table2 %>% filter(type == "population") %>% select(-type) %>% rename(population = count )
t4_pop <- table4b %>% gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
```

Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.

```{r}
t2_rate <- t2_cases %>% left_join(t2_pop, by = c("country", "year")) %>% mutate(count = (cases / population) * 10000) %>% select(-cases, -population) %>% mutate(type = "rate") %>% select(country, year, type, count)

t4_rate <- t4_cases %>% left_join(t4_pop, by = c("country", "year")) %>% mutate(count = (cases / population) * 10000) %>% select(-cases, -population) %>% mutate(type = "rate") %>% select(country, year, count)
```

Store back in the appropriate place.

```{r}

table2_new <- left_join(table2, t2_rate)
table2_new

table4c <- t4_rate %>% spread(year, count)
table4c
```

Recreate the plot showing change in cases over time using `table2`
    instead of `table1`. What do you need to do first?
    
```{r}
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)

table2_s <- table2_new %>% spread(type, count) %>% mutate(cases = as.integer(cases), population = as.integer(population))

table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)

table2_s %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))

ggplot(table2_s, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))
```

## Exercises 12.3.3

Why are `gather()` and `spread()` not perfectly symmetrical?  
    Carefully consider the following example:

```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half  = c(   1,    2,     1,    2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
)
stocks
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather("year", "return", `2015`:`2016`)
```
    (Hint: look at the variable types and think about column _names_.)
    
    Both `spread()` and `gather()` have a `convert` argument. What does it 
    do?

```{r}
df <- data.frame(row = rep(c(1, 51), each = 3),
                 var = c("Sepal.Length", "Species", "Species_num"),
                 value = c(5.1, "setosa", 1, 7.0, "versicolor", 2))
df

df1 <- df %>% spread(var, value) 
df1 %>% str
df1

df2 <- df %>% spread(var, value, convert = TRUE) 
df2 %>% str
df2

df3 <- df1 %>% gather("var", "value", Sepal.Length:Species_num, convert = TRUE)
df3 %>% str
df3
```

Why does this code fail?

```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

Why does spreading this tibble fail? How could you add a new column to fix
    the problem?
    
Phillip Woods has two record for his age (45 and 50).

```{r}
people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,
  #-----------------|--------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156
)

people %>%
  mutate(id = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3)) %>%
  select(id, everything()) %>%
  spread(key, value)
```

Tidy the simple tibble below. Do you need to spread or gather it?
    What are the variables?
    
```{r}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)

preg %>%
  gather(`male`, `female`, key = "sex", value = "count")
```

## Exercises 12.4.3

What do the `extra` and `fill` arguments do in `separate()`? 
    Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets.

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "drop")

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), fill = "right")
```
  
Both `unite()` and `separate()` have a `remove` argument. What does it
    do? Why would you set it to `FALSE`?

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "drop", remove = TRUE)
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "drop", remove = FALSE)

tibble(one = c("a","d","h"), two = c("b","e","i"), three = c("c","f","j")) %>%
  unite(x, one, two, three, sep = "")
tibble(one = c("a","d","h"), two = c("b","e","i"), three = c("c","f","j")) %>%
  unite(x, one, two, three, sep = "", remove = FALSE)
```

Compare and contrast `separate()` and `extract()`.  Why are there
    three variations of separation (by position, by separator, and with
    groups), but only one unite?
    
```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
tibble(x = c("a|b|c", "d|e|f", "h|i|j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```

    
## Exercises 12.5.1

Compare and contrast the fill arguments to spread() and complete().

```{r}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  "Joe Black",        2,           NA,
  "Mary Smith",       3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  NA,           4
)

treatmentg <- treatment %>% gather(unit, count, -person)

treatmentg <- treatmentg %>% add_row(person = "Pete James", unit = "response", count = 2)
treatmentg <- treatmentg %>% add_row(person = "Bob Kirk", unit = "treatment", count = 4)

treatments <- treatmentg %>% spread(unit, count, fill = -9) 

df <- tibble(
  group = c(1:2, 1),
  item_id = c(1:2, 2),
  item_name = c("a", "b", "b"),
  value1 = 1:3,
  value2 = 4:6
)
df2 <- df %>% complete(group, nesting(item_id, item_name))
df2 %>% complete(group, nesting(item_id, item_name), fill = list(value1 = 0, value2 = 5))
```

What does the direction argument to fill() do?

```{r}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           NA,
  "Mary Smith",       3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  NA,           4
)

treatment %>% fill(person)
treatment %>% fill(person, .direction = "up")
```

## Exercises 12.6.1

In this case study I set na.rm = TRUE just to make it easier to check that we had the correct values. Is this reasonable? Think about how missing values are represented in this dataset. Are there implicit missing values? Whatâ€™s the difference between an NA and zero?

```{r}
who

who1 <- who %>% 
  gather(new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases", na.rm = TRUE)
who1

who1 %>% 
  count(key)


who2 <- who %>% 
  gather(new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases", na.rm = FALSE)
who2

who2 %>% 
  count(key)
```

What happens if you neglect the mutate() step? (mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")))

```{r}
who3 <- who1 %>% 
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))
who4 <- who3 %>% 
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")


who4 <- who1 %>% 
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")
```

I claimed that iso2 and iso3 were redundant with country. Confirm this claim.

```{r}
select(who3, country, iso2, iso3) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)
```

For each country, year, and sex compute the total number of cases of TB. Make an informative visualisation of the data.

```{r}
who1 <- who %>% 
  gather(new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases", na.rm = TRUE)

who2 <- who1 %>% 
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))


who3 <- who2 %>% 
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")
who3

who4 <- who3 %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1, convert = TRUE)
who5 <- who4 %>% group_by(country, year, sex) %>% summarise(count = sum((cases)))
```
