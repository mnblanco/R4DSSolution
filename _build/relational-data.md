### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.2.1.1</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What tables would you need to combine?
</div>

<div class="answer">

-   `flights` table: `origin` and `dest`
-   `airports` table: longitude and latitude variables
-   join `flights` with `airports` twice. The first join adds the location of the origin airport (`origin`). The second join adds the location of destination airport (`dest`).

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.2.1.2</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
I forgot to draw the relationship between weather and airports. What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram?
</div>

<div class="answer">

The variable `origin` in `weather` is matched with `faa` in `airports`.

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.2.1.3</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Weather only contains information for the origin (NYC) airports. If it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional relation would it define with `flights`?
</div>

<div class="answer">

`year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `origin` in `weather` would be matched to `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `dest` in `flight` (though it should use the arrival date-time values for `dest` if possible).

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.2.1.4</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
We know that some days of the year are “special”, and fewer people than usual fly on them. How might you represent that data as a data frame? What would be the primary keys of that table? How would it connect to the existing tables?
</div>

<div class="answer">

I would add a table of special dates.
Its primary key would be  `date`.
This would match to the `year`, `month`,
and `day` columns of `flights.

The table would resemble the following:

```r
special_days <- tribble(
  ~year, ~month, ~day, ~holiday,
  2013, 01, 01, "New Years Day",
  2013, 07, 04, "Independence Day",
  2013, 11, 29, "Thanksgiving Day",
  2013, 12, 25, "Christmas Day"
)
```

</div>

## Keys

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.3.1.1</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Add a surrogate key to flights.
</div>

<div class="answer">

I add the column `flight_id` as a surrogate key.
I sort the data prior to making the key, even though it is not strictly necessary, so the order of the rows has some meaning.

```r
flights %>%
  arrange(year, month, day, sched_dep_time, carrier, flight) %>%
  mutate(flight_id = row_number()) %>%
  glimpse()

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.3.1.2</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Identify the keys in the following datasets

1.  `Lahman::Batting`
1.  `babynames::babynames`
1.  `nasaweather::atmos`
1.  `fueleconomy::vehicles`
1.  `ggplot2::diamonds`

(You might need to install some packages and read some documentation.)

</div>

<div class="answer">

The answer to each part follows.

1.  The primary key for `Lahman::Batting` is `playerID`, `yearID`, `stint`.
    It is not simply `playerID`, `yearID` because players can have different stints in different leagues within the same year.

    
    ```r
    Lahman::Batting %>%
      group_by(playerID, yearID, stint) %>%
      filter(n() > 1) %>%
      nrow()
    #> [1] 0
    ```

1.  The primary key for `babynames::babynames` is `year`, `sex`, `name`.
    It is not simply `year`, `name` since names can appear for both sexes with different counts.

    
    ```r
    babynames::babynames %>%
      group_by(year, sex, name) %>%
      filter(n() > 1) %>%
      nrow()
    #> [1] 0
    ```

1.  The primary key for `nasaweather::atmos` is the location and time of the measurement: `lat`, `long`, `year`, `month`.

    
    ```r
    nasaweather::atmos %>%
      group_by(lat, long, year, month) %>%
      filter(n() > 1) %>%
      nrow()
    #> [1] 0
    ```

1.  The column `id` (unique EPA identifier) is the primary key for `fueleconomy::vehicles`:

    
    ```r
    fueleconomy::vehicles %>%
      group_by(id) %>%
      filter(n() > 1) %>%
      nrow()
    #> [1] 0
    ```

1.  There is no primary key for `ggplot2::diamonds`.
    The number of distinct rows in the dataset is less than the total number of rows, which implies that there is no combination of variables uniquely identifies the observations.

    
    ```r
    ggplot2::diamonds %>%
      distinct() %>%
      nrow()
    #> [1] 53794
    nrow(ggplot2::diamonds)
    #> [1] 53940
    ```

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.3.1.3</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the `Batting`, `Master`, and `Salaries` tables in the **Lahman** package. Draw another diagram that shows the relationship between `Master`, `Managers`, `AwardsManagers`.

Most flowchart or diagramming software can be used used to create database schema diagrams.
For example, the diagrams in *R for Data Science* were created with [Gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/).

You can use anything to create these diagrams, but I'll use the R package [datamodelr](https://github.com/bergant/datamodelr) to programmatically create data models from R.

For the `Batting`, `Master`, and `Salaries` tables:

-   `Master`

    -   Primary keys: `playerID`

-   `Batting`

    -   Primary keys: `yearID`, `yearID`, `stint`

    -   Foreign Keys:

        -   `playerID` = `Master$playerID` (many-to-1)

-   `Salaries`

    -   Primary keys: `yearID`, `teamID`, `playerID`

    -   Foreign Keys

        -   `playerID` = `Master$playerID` (many-to-1)


```r
dm1 <- dm_from_data_frames(list(Batting = Lahman::Batting,
                                Master = Lahman::Master,
                                Salaries = Lahman::Salaries)) %>%
  dm_set_key("Batting", c("playerID", "yearID", "stint")) %>%
  dm_set_key("Master", "playerID") %>%
  dm_set_key("Salaries", c("yearID", "teamID", "playerID")) %>%
  dm_add_references(
    Batting$playerID == Master$playerID,
    Salaries$playerID == Master$playerID
  )

dm_create_graph(dm1, rankdir = "LR", columnArrows = TRUE)
```

For the `Master`, `Manager`, and `AwardsManagers` tables:

-   `Master`

    -   Primary keys: `playerID`

-   `Managers`

    -   Primary keys: `yearID`, `teamID`, `inseason`

    -   Foreign Keys:

        -   `playerID` = `Master$playerID` (many-to-1)

-   `AwardsManagers`:

    -   `playerID` = `Master$playerID` (many-to-1)


```r
dm2 <- dm_from_data_frames(list(Master = Lahman::Master,
                                Managers = Lahman::Managers,
                                AwardsManagers = Lahman::AwardsManagers)) %>%
  dm_set_key("Master", "playerID") %>%
  dm_set_key("Managers", c("yearID", "teamID", "inseason")) %>%
  dm_set_key("AwardsManagers", c("playerID", "awardID", "yearID")) %>%
  dm_add_references(
    Managers$playerID == Master$playerID,
    AwardsManagers$playerID == Master$playerID
  )

dm_create_graph(dm2, rankdir = "LR", columnArrows = TRUE)
```

In the previous diagrams, I do not consider `teamID` and `lgID` as foreign keys even though they appear in multiple tables (and have the same meaning) because they are not primary keys in the tables considered in this exercise.
The `teamID` variable references `Teams$teamID`, and `lgID` does not have its own table.

How would you characterize the relationship between the `Batting`, `Pitching`, and `Fielding` tables?

The `Batting`, `Pitching`, and `Fielding` tables all have a primary key consisting of the `playerID`, `yearID`, and `stint` variables.
They all have a 1-1 relationship to each other.

## Mutating Joins


```r
flights2 <- flights %>%
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
```

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.4.6.1</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the `airports` data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:
</div>

<div class="answer">


```r
airports %>%
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap()
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'maps'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
#> 
#>     map
```

<img src="relational-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

(Don’t worry if you don’t understand what `semi_join()` does — you’ll learn about it next.)


```r
avg_dest_delays <-
  flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  # arrival delay NA's are cancelled flights
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  inner_join(airports, by = c(dest = "faa"))

avg_dest_delays %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat, colour = delay)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap()
```

<img src="relational-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

You might want to use the size or color of the points to display the average delay for each airport.

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.4.6.2</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Add the location of the origin and destination (i.e. the `lat` and `lon`) to `flights`.
</div>

<div class="answer">

You can perform one join after another. If duplicate variables are found, by default, dplyr will distinguish the two by adding `.x`, and `.y` to the ends of the variable names to solve naming conflicts.

```r
airport_locations <- airports %>%
  select(faa, lat, lon)

flights %>%
    select(year:day, hour, origin, dest) %>%
  left_join(
    airport_locations,
    by = c("origin" = "faa")
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    airport_locations,
    by = c("dest" = "faa")
  )
#> # A tibble: 336,776 x 10
#>    year month   day  hour origin dest  lat.x lon.x lat.y lon.y
#>   <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <chr>  <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1  2013     1     1     5 EWR    IAH    40.7 -74.2  30.0 -95.3
#> 2  2013     1     1     5 LGA    IAH    40.8 -73.9  30.0 -95.3
#> 3  2013     1     1     5 JFK    MIA    40.6 -73.8  25.8 -80.3
#> 4  2013     1     1     5 JFK    BQN    40.6 -73.8  NA    NA  
#> 5  2013     1     1     6 LGA    ATL    40.8 -73.9  33.6 -84.4
#> 6  2013     1     1     5 EWR    ORD    40.7 -74.2  42.0 -87.9
#> # ... with 3.368e+05 more rows
```
This default can be over-ridden using the `suffix` argument.

```r
airport_locations <- airports %>%
  select(faa, lat, lon)

flights %>%
    select(year:day, hour, origin, dest) %>%
  left_join(
    airport_locations,
    by = c("origin" = "faa")
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    airport_locations,
    by = c("dest" = "faa"),
    suffix = c("_origin", "_dest")
    # existing lat and lon variables in tibble gain the _origin suffix
    # new lat and lon variables are given _dest suffix
  )
#> # A tibble: 336,776 x 10
#>    year month   day  hour origin dest  lat_origin lon_origin lat_dest
#>   <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <chr>  <chr>      <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>
#> 1  2013     1     1     5 EWR    IAH         40.7      -74.2     30.0
#> 2  2013     1     1     5 LGA    IAH         40.8      -73.9     30.0
#> 3  2013     1     1     5 JFK    MIA         40.6      -73.8     25.8
#> 4  2013     1     1     5 JFK    BQN         40.6      -73.8     NA  
#> 5  2013     1     1     6 LGA    ATL         40.8      -73.9     33.6
#> 6  2013     1     1     5 EWR    ORD         40.7      -74.2     42.0
#> # ... with 3.368e+05 more rows, and 1 more variable: lon_dest <dbl>
```
It's always good practice to have clear variable names.

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.4.6.3</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?
</div>

<div class="answer">

Surprisingly not. If anything (departure) delay seems to decrease slightly with the age of the plane.
This could be due to choices about how airlines allocate planes to airports.

```r
plane_ages <-
  planes %>%
  mutate(age = 2013 - year) %>%
  select(tailnum, age)

flights %>%
  inner_join(plane_ages, by = "tailnum") %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
#> Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
#> Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_path).

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.4.6.4</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
What weather conditions make it more likely to see a delay?
</div>

<div class="answer">

Almost any amount or precipitation is associated with a delay, though not as strong a trend after 0.02 in as one would expect

```r
flight_weather <-
  flights %>%
  inner_join(weather, by = c("origin" = "origin",
                            "year" = "year",

                            "hour" = "hour"))

flight_weather %>%

<div class="answer">

There was a large series of storms (derechos) in the southeastern US (see [June 12-13, 2013 derecho series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_12%E2%80%9313,_2013_derecho_series))

The largest delays are in Tennessee (Nashville), the Southeast, and the Midwest, which were the locations of the derechos:

## Filtering Joins

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.5.1.1</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
What does it mean for a flight to have a missing `tailnum`? What do the tail numbers that don’t have a matching record in planes have in common? (Hint: one variable explains ~90% of the problems.)

<div class="answer">

American Airlines (AA) and Envoy Airlines (MQ) don't report tail numbers.

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.5.1.5</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
What does `anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))` tell you? What does `anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))` tell you?
</div>

<div class="answer">

`anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))` are flights that go to an airport that is not in FAA list of destinations, likely foreign airports.

`anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))` are US airports that don't have a flight in the data, meaning that there were no flights to that airport **from** New York in 2013.

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">13.5.1.6</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
You might expect that there’s an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm or reject this hypothesis using the tools you’ve learned above.
</div>

<div class="answer">

There isn't such a relationship over the lifetime of an airplane since planes can be sold or leased and airlines can merge.
However, even though that's a possibility, it doesn't necessarily mean that plane associated with more than one  appear in this data.
Let's check:

```r
multi_carrier_planes <-
  flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%
  count(tailnum, carrier) %>%
  count(tailnum) %>%
  filter(nn > 1)
multi_carrier_planes
#> # A tibble: 17 x 2
#>   tailnum    nn
#>   <chr>   <int>
#> 1 N146PQ      2
#> 2 N153PQ      2
#> 3 N176PQ      2
#> 4 N181PQ      2
#> 5 N197PQ      2
#> 6 N200PQ      2
#> # ... with 11 more rows
```
There are 17 airplanes in this dataset that have had more than one carrier.

To see which carriers these planes have been associated, filter the `flights` by `tailnum` in `multi_carrier_planes`, and extract the unique combinations of `tailnum` and `carrier`.

```r
multi_carrier_planes <-
  flights %>%
  semi_join(multi_carrier_planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  select(tailnum, carrier) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(tailnum)
multi_carrier_planes
#> # A tibble: 34 x 2
#>   tailnum carrier
#>   <chr>   <chr>  
#> 1 N146PQ  9E     
#> 2 N146PQ  EV     
#> 3 N153PQ  9E     
#> 4 N153PQ  EV     
#> 5 N176PQ  9E     
#> 6 N176PQ  EV     
#> # ... with 28 more rows
```

The names of airlines are easier to understand than the two-letter carrier codes.
Join the multi-airline table with the associated airline in `airlines` using the `carrier` column.
The spread the data so it has columns `carrier_1`, `carrier_2`, and so on.
This is not tidy, but it is more easier to display.

```r
carrier_transfer_tbl <-
  multi_carrier_planes %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  mutate(
    carrier_num = seq_along(tailnum),
    carrier_num = paste0("carrier_", carrier_num)
  ) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(-carrier) %>%
  spread(carrier_num, name)
carrier_transfer_tbl
#> # A tibble: 17 x 3
#> # Groups:   tailnum [17]
#>   tailnum carrier_1         carrier_2               
#>   <chr>   <chr>             <chr>                   
#> 1 N146PQ  Endeavor Air Inc. ExpressJet Airlines Inc.
#> 2 N153PQ  Endeavor Air Inc. ExpressJet Airlines Inc.
#> 3 N176PQ  Endeavor Air Inc. ExpressJet Airlines Inc.
#> 4 N181PQ  Endeavor Air Inc. ExpressJet Airlines Inc.
#> 5 N197PQ  Endeavor Air Inc. ExpressJet Airlines Inc.
#> 6 N200PQ  Endeavor Air Inc. ExpressJet Airlines Inc.
