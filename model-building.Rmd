## Why are low quality diamonds more expensive?

```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>%
  filter(carat <= 2.5) %>%
  mutate(lprice = log2(price), lcarat = log2(carat))

mod_diamond2 <- lm(lprice ~ lcarat + color + cut + clarity, data = diamonds2)
```

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.2.3.1</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
In the plot of `lcarat` vs. `lprice`, there are some bright vertical strips. What do they represent?
</div>

<div class="answer">

The distribution of diamonds has more diamonds at round or otherwise human friendly numbers (fractions).

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.2.3.2</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
If `log(price) = a_0 + a_1 * log(carat)`, what does that say about the relationship between `price` and `carat`?
</div>

<div class="answer">

A 1% increase in carat is associated with an $a_1$% increase in price.

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.2.3.3</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Extract the diamonds that have very high and very low residuals. Is there anything unusual about these diamonds? Are the particularly bad or good, or do you think these are pricing errors?
</div>

<div class="answer">

This was already discussed in the text. I don't see anything either.

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.2.3.4</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Does the final model, `mod_diamonds2`, do a good job of predicting diamond prices? Would you trust it to tell you how much to spend if you were buying a diamond?
</div>

<div class="answer">

```{r}
diamonds2 %>%
  add_predictions(mod_diamond2) %>%
  add_residuals(mod_diamond2) %>%
  summarise(sq_err = sqrt(mean(resid^2)),
            abs_err = mean(abs(resid)),
            p975_err = quantile(resid, 0.975),
            p025_err = quantile(resid, 0.025))

```

The average squared and absolute errors are $2^0.19 = 1.14$ and $2^0.10$ so on average, the error is $\pm 10--15$%.
And the 95% range of residuals is about $2^0.37 = 1.3$ so within $\pm 30$%.
This doesn't seem terrible to me.

</div>

## What affects the number of daily flights?

```{r}
library("nycflights13")
daily <- flights %>%
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day)) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
daily

daily <- daily %>%
  mutate(wday = wday(date, label = TRUE))

term <- function(date) {
  cut(date,
    breaks = ymd(20130101, 20130605, 20130825, 20140101),
    labels = c("spring", "summer", "fall")
  )
}

daily <- daily %>%
  mutate(term = term(date))

mod <- lm(n ~ wday, data = daily)

daily <- daily %>%
  add_residuals(mod)

mod1 <- lm(n ~ wday, data = daily)
mod2 <- lm(n ~ wday * term, data = daily)

```

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.3.5.1</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Use your Google sleuthing skills to brainstorm why there were fewer than expected flights on Jan 20, May 26, and Sep 1. (Hint: they all have the same explanation.) How would these days generalize to another year?
</div>

<div class="answer">

These are the Sundays before Monday holidays Martin Luther King Day, Memorial Day, and Labor Day.

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.3.5.3</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Create a new variable that splits the `wday` variable into terms, but only for Saturdays, i.e. it should have `Thurs`, `Fri`, but `Sat-summer`, `Sat-spring`, `Sat-fall` How does this model compare with the model with every combination of `wday` and `term`?
</div>

<div class="answer">

I'll use the function `case_when()` to do this, though there are other ways which it could be solved.
```{r}
daily <- daily %>%
  mutate(wday2 =
         case_when(.$wday == "Sat" & .$term == "summer" ~ "Sat-summer",
         .$wday == "Sat" & .$ term == "fall" ~ "Sat-fall",
         .$wday == "Sat" & .$term == "spring" ~ "Sat-spring",
         TRUE ~ as.character(.$wday)))
```

```{r}
mod4 <- lm(n ~ wday2, data = daily)

daily %>%
  gather_residuals(sat_term = mod4, all_interact = mod2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, resid, colour = model)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.75)
```

I think the overlapping plot is hard to understand.
If we are interested in the differences, it is better to plot the differences directly.
In this code, I use `spread_residuals()` to add one *column* per model, rather than `gather_residuals()` which creates a new row for each model.
```{r}
daily %>%
  spread_residuals(sat_term = mod4, all_interact = mod2) %>%
  mutate(resid_diff = sat_term - all_interact) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, resid_diff)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.75)
```

The model with terms x Saturday has higher residuals in the fall, and lower residuals in the spring than the model with all interactions.

Using overall model comparison terms, `mod4` has a lower $R^2$ and regression standard error, $\hat\sigma$, despite using fewer variables.
More importantly for prediction purposes, it has a higher AIC - which is an estimate of the out of sample error.
```{r}
glance(mod4) %>% select(r.squared, sigma, AIC, df)
```
```{r}
glance(mod2) %>% select(r.squared, sigma, AIC, df)
```

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.3.5.4</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
Create a new `wday` variable that combines the day of week, term (for Saturdays), and public holidays. What do the residuals of that model look like?
</div>

<div class="answer">

The question is unclear how to handle the public holidays. We could include a dummy for all public holidays? or the Sunday before public holidays?

Including a level for the public holidays themselves is insufficient because (1) public holiday's effects on travel varies dramatically, (2) the effect can occur on the day itself or the day before and after, and (3) with Thanksgiving and Christmas there are increases in travel as well.

```{r}
daily <- daily %>%
  mutate(wday3 =
         case_when(
           .$date %in% lubridate::ymd(c(20130101, # new years
                                        20130121, # mlk
                                        20130218, # presidents

                                        20131128, # thanksgiving
                                        20131225)) ~
             "holiday",
           .$wday == "Sat" & .$term == "summer" ~ "Sat-summer",
           .$wday == "Sat" & .$ term == "fall" ~ "Sat-fall",
           .$wday == "Sat" & .$term == "spring" ~ "Sat-spring",
           TRUE ~ as.character(.$wday)))

mod5 <- lm(n ~ wday3, data = daily)

daily %>%
  spread_residuals(mod5) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(resid))) %>%
  slice(1:20) %>% select(date, wday, resid)

```

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.3.5.5</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
What happens if you fit a day of week effect that varies by month (i.e. `n ~ wday * month`)? Why is this not very helpful?
</div>

<div class="answer">

There are only 4-5 observations per parameter since only there are only 4-5 weekdays in a given month.

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.3.5.6</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

It will estimate a smooth seasonal trend (`ns(date, 5)`) with a day of the week cyclicality, (`wday`).
It probably will not be effective since

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.3.5.7</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
We hypothesized that people leaving on Sundays are more likely to be business travelers who need to be somewhere on Monday. Explore that hypothesis by seeing how it breaks down based on distance and time: if it’s true, you’d expect to see more Sunday evening flights to places that are far away.
</div>

<div class="answer">

Looking at only day of the week, we see that Sunday flights are on average longer than the rest of the day of the week flights, but not as long as Saturday flights (perhaps vacation flights?).
```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day),
         wday = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(wday) %>%
  summarise(dist_mean =  mean(distance),
            dist_median = median(distance)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = dist_mean, x = wday)) +
  geom_point()
```

However, breaking it down by hour, I don't see much evidence at first.
Conditional on hour, the distance of Sunday flights seems similar to that of other days (excluding Saturday):

```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day),
         wday = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(wday, hour) %>%
  summarise(dist_mean =  mean(distance),
            dist_median = median(distance)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = dist_mean, x = hour, colour = wday)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

Can someone think of a better way to check this?

</div>

### Exercise <span class="exercise-number">24.3.5.8</span> {.unnumbered .exercise}

<div class="question">
It’s a little frustrating that Sunday and Saturday are on separate ends of the plot. Write a small function to set the levels of the factor so that the week starts on Monday.
</div>

<div class="answer">

See the chapter [Factors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) for the function `fct_relevel()`.
Use `fct_relevel()` to put all levels in-front of the first level ("Sunday").

```{r}
monday_first <- function(x) {
  forcats::fct_relevel(x, levels(x)[-1])  
}
```

Now Monday is the first day of the week,
```{r}
daily <- daily %>%
  mutate(wday = wday(date, label = TRUE))
ggplot(daily, aes(monday_first(wday), n)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Day of Week", y = "Number of flights")
```
